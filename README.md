# FridayProject7
# Welcome to the Python Projects collection! This repository includes various interactive Python programs to practice foundational programming skills, including classes, functions, loops, conditionals, and user input handling. Each project is designed to improve understanding of specific concepts and provide hands-on experience with Python's functionality.

# Project Details:

# Project 1: Mad Lib Game
# Overview:
# This project is a simple word game that allows users to create a fun story by filling in blanks with their own words, such as nouns, adjectives, and body parts. It demonstrates the basics of user input and string formatting.

# Expectations:

# Collect user input for specified types of words (e.g., nouns, adjectives).
# Display a story template filled in with the user’s responses.
# Reinforce skills in user interaction and basic string manipulation.

# Project 2: Lottery Number Generator
# Overview:
# This project generates random numbers for a PowerBall ticket, allowing users to pick five numbers between 1 and 69, plus one number between 1 and 26. It uses the random module to simulate the lottery drawing.

# Expectations:

# Generate and display six random numbers (five white balls and one red ball).
# Separate the last number from the others for clarity.
# Practice using Python’s random module and basic print formatting.

# Project 3: Number Guessing Game
# Overview:
# A guessing game where the computer selects a random number between 1 and 10, and the user tries to guess the correct number. The game loops until the correct answer is guessed or the user chooses to quit.

# Expectations:

# Continuously prompt the user for guesses.
# Use an if statement to check if the guess is correct, and a while loop to keep the game running until the user is successful.
# Build comfort with looping structures, conditionals, and random number generation.

 # Project 4: Trivia Study Program
# Overview:
# This project is an interactive trivia quiz that displays a series of questions, accepts answers from the user, and provides feedback on correctness. A dictionary is used to store questions and answers.

# Expectations:

# Use a dictionary to store questions as keys and answers as values.
# Use a for loop to go through each question, prompting the user for their answer.
# Provide feedback on whether each answer is correct, building knowledge of dictionary and looping structures.

# Project 5: Text Color Changer
# Overview:
# This project allows the user to display text in different colors by calling specific functions that format the text with ANSI color codes. It’s a fun way to learn about functions, parameters, and return values.

# Expectations:

# Define five functions, each applying a different color format to the text.
# Prompt the user to choose a color and display their input text in that color.
# Reinforce skills with functions, parameters, and return values, as well as working with color formatting in the console.

# Project 6: Bank Account Management System
# Overview:
# This project simulates a simple bank account system. The program allows users to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance after entering their account number. It uses a BankAccount class to define attributes and methods related to account management.

# Expectations:

# Create a BankAccount class with methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance.
# Use an indefinite loop to allow the user to continue performing actions on their account.
# Provide practice with object-oriented programming concepts, including classes, attributes, methods, and loops.
